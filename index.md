My main interest is improving efficiency of algorithms with using assembly level optimizations. I am also interested in math, cryptography, computer architecture, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing and hardware accelerators. 

Currently I am doing PhD at [Department of Mathematics][dep2] of Ege University in İzmir, Turkey.
My dissemination topic is "Analysis, Design and Efficient implementation of Next Generation Cryptosystems", and I am studying
on implementation issues of lattice-based cryptosystems.

Currently I am a visiting student in [Digital Security Group](http://www.ru.nl/ds), Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.

During My master, I studied on the FPGA implementations of some algorithms that have applications in cryptography, coding theory, signal processing and machine learning.  
I had my MSc. degree from [Department of Computer Engineering][dep] 
of Ondokuz Mayıs University in Samsun, Turkey. 
During my master study, I have worked as a research assistant in the
department and also participated in two
Scientific Research Projects.

I have [published](/pubs.html) papers on topics in artificial neural networks, hardware implementation, parallel processing and also lattice-based cryptography. 

I can be reached at work by email at [erdemalkim@gmail.com](mailto:erdemalkim@gmail.com).
