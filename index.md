I'm a statistician, hardware designer and software programmer. I am studying on the FPGA implementations of some algorithms that have applications in cryptography, coding theory, signal processing and machine learning. I am also interested in computer architecture, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing and hardware accelerators.

Currently I am searching for PhD possition in Computer Architecture. 
I have just had my MSc. degree from [Department of Computer Engineering][dep] 
of [Ondokuz Mayıs University](http://www.omu.edu.tr/) in Samsun, Turkey. 
During my master study, I have worked as a research assistant in the
department and also participated in two
Scientific Research Projects.

I have [published](/pubs/) papers on topics in artificial neural networks, hardware implementation and parallel processing. 

I can be reached at work by email at [erdem.alkim@ce.omu.edu.tr](mailto:erdem.alkim@ce.omu.edu.tr).
