My main interest is improving efficiency of algorithms with using assembly level optimizations. I am also interested in math, cryptography, computer architecture, parallel programming, heterogeneous computing and hardware accelerators. 

Currently I am doing PhD at [Department of Mathematics][dep2] of Ege University in İzmir, Turkey.
My dissemination topic is "Analysis, Design and Efficient implementation of Next Generation Cryptosystems", and my advisors are [Urfat Nuriyev](http://fen.ege.edu.tr/~urfat/eng_kisisel_bilgiler.html) and [Peter Schwabe](https://www.cryptojedi.org). I am also working with [Sedat Akleylek](https://sites.google.com/a/bil.omu.edu.tr/akleylek/home) in several projects.

Currently I am a visiting student in [Digital Security Group](http://www.ru.nl/ds), Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.
In here, I have been working on efficient implementations lattice-based cryptography with [Peter Schwage](https://www.cryptojedi.org), since April 2015.

During My master, I studied on the FPGA implementations of some algorithms that have applications in cryptography, coding theory, signal processing and machine learning.  
I had my MSc. degree from [Department of Computer Engineering][dep] 
of Ondokuz Mayıs University in Samsun, Turkey. 
During my master study, I have worked as a research assistant in the
department and also participated in two
Scientific Research Projects.

I have [published](/pubs.html) papers on topics in artificial neural networks, hardware implementation, parallel processing and also lattice-based cryptography.
